            <em><h2>Current Scenario of Students:</h2></em>
            <p>One of the most important challenges among students studying in class 10 or class 12 is what to do after passing that respective class. For class 10 students, the challenge is to choose between science, commerce and arts branch. This challenge is quite big for students who are about to pass class 12 as they have a huge array of domains to select. Some of these domains include Engineering, Medical, Law etc. and even among these domains there are large amounts of sub-domains to choose from. This can be quite overwhelming for majority of the students, and it might happen that due to extreme stress of choosing between these domains, students make a mistake and end up regretting that in the future. A wrong choice in one phase of life can lead to many wrong choices in the future. Students might end up being depressed because they are not able to handle the course they have selected. This was because the course was not in alignment with their domain of interest. In the past, that student might have selected the future course in a haste and would not have considered his interests and strengths while doing so. For instance, consider a student who is about to pass his class 10 and the topics which he is interested in are accounting and business-related. Now, consider that he failed to realize his interests and chose science branch in class 11 instead of commerce branch as science has a huge scope in the future. Now, after few months, he realizes that he is not able to grab the subjects which are being taught in the science branch and starts to struggle a lot. Now, due to that, he might fail in the subjects and fall into the hands of depression which can sometimes lead to suicide. All this happened because he did not realize his interests in the first place. This is applicable to students who are about to pass class 12 too. This is a problem that many students are facing currently.</p>
